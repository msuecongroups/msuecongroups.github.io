<p class=MsoNormal>The International Trade group offers a rich array of scholars
with research agendas that address many of the major issues in that field
today.&nbsp; Carl Davidson, Steven Matusz and John (Jay) Wilson are senior
colleagues with records of scholarship that each span over 40 years.&nbsp;
Davidson and Matusz have been pioneers in the study of the impact of trade on
labor market outcomes in the presence of imperfect labor markets, while John
Wilson has been a major contributor to the literatures on taxation and
international factor mobility, including tax competition among governments, tax
havens, and the "brain drain" (or "brain gain") created by developing country
emigration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This senior group has had their contributions
appear in journals such as <i>American Economic Review, Journal of Political
Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>,<i> Econometrica and Review of
Economic Studies.&nbsp; </i>Susan Zhu is a mid-career scholar with 20 years of
experience.&nbsp; Her research focuses on the impact of international
trade on wage inequality and worker mobility, and the effect of financial
constraints on firm export and supply chain participation.&nbsp; Her work has
appeared in outlets such as <i>Review of Economics and Statistics, Journal of
the European Economics Association, Journal of International Economics, Journal
of Development Economics </i>and <i>European Economic Review.&nbsp; </i>The
group's junior member is Oren Ziv.&nbsp; His work focuses on empirical aspects
of urban economics, economic geography and international trade with a
particular interest in the location decisions of firms and how geographic
frictions affect market outcomes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#201F1E'>The International Finance group studies topics at the
intersection of international finance, macroeconomics, and trade. The group has
had its contributions appear in economics and finance journals such as the <i>Journal
of Financial Economics</i>, <i>Journal of the European Economic Association</i>,
<i>Journal of Monetary Economics</i>, <i>Economic Journal</i> and <i>Journal of
International Economics</i>. Qingqing Cao studies the macroeconomic impact of
multinational banks in order to determine their role in international shock
transmission and business cycle dynamics, and to better understand the
implications of banking regulation and macroprudential policies. Raoul
Minetti's research on international topics, in turn, focuses on two areas: the
interaction between finance and international trade (in various projects in
collaboration with international trade scholar Susan Zhu), and the impact of
credit markets and banking sectors on international business cycles. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:#201F1E'>All of our international economists are active in advising
doctoral students, with PhD placements including the University of Oregon,
University of Essex, Trinity University, the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, Furman University, the OECD, the Bank of Italy, and the Korea Institute of Finance,
and the Korea Institute for Economic Policy. Below you
will find a list of recent publications and some other notable publications
from the past two decades, as well as links to the vitae of the members of the
group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
